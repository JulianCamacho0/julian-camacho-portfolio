# julian-camacho-portfolio
A personal web portfolio built with Streamlit, showcasing my professional experience, projects, résumé, and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. The site also includes a space for a technical blog where I share insights, experiments, and learning resources related to technology and data.
